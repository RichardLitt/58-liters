I carried this around with me, but it weighed a ton. The [Nikon D7000](http://amzn.to/2nEoD64) weighs almost two pounds (780g), which is far too much to justify carrying it around all of the time, considering I had my phone as well and that, at the time, I wasn't doing any major photography. I did take a few beautiful shots with it - in particular, when I was heading down to Koh Lanta by a [train out of Bangkok](/train-ticket). I bought this camera at B&H in New York, convinced I would start my career as a photojournalist soon. Instead, I largely take photos of birds, for which I need to significantly up the lens for better quality, anyway.

I've since upgraded to the [Sony RX100](http://amzn.to/2oU7V2C), which is much smaller and has better steadiness for walking and shooting. Unfortunately, the battery life is atrocious. I'll find a great camera some day.
