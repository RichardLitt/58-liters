My ex-brother in law bought me this. He was Colombian, and when I tried to speak Spanish to him, he would gently laugh.
I often messed up pronouncing cu単ado, meaning brother in law, and would say co単ado, which means nothing but sounds like co単o, a not-very-nice word in the States.

Of course, he's me ex-brother in law now. Turns out co単ado was the right pronunciation after all.
