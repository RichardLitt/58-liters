Standing in the scooter rental place in Chiang Mai, my friend was adamant.

"No, we're not letting you get a scooter."

"But I've ridden one before"

"That's not the same as driving one."

"I used to own ATVs and snowmobiles, I'll be fine."

"That's what my girlfriend said last month. Then I was holding her head, making sure her brains stayed inside, followed by weeks in the hospital and surgery. No."

I left, angrily.

Round the corner, I found an analog bicycle next to a few other scooters. I asked the proprietor if I could rent one. She said no problem, and gave me this receipt as a deposit. I rode my silly bike through town for the next few weeks, basket and all.

A few weeks later, I met a girl outside a cafe who said she was going into the mountains that weekend to visit an old anarchist German friend of hers, who was building his own house. I asked if I could come too. Half way there, we switched, and I finally got some experience driving in the end. Nobody died.

A few months ago, I had dinner with my friend's ex, miles away, on another continent.

"I've not been the same, since the accident. I forget things."

I barely remember what my bicycle looked like, now, too. But I remember wind in my hair, coming down out of the mountains, and the long, wide Thai highway beneath me.
