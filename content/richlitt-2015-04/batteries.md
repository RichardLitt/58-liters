I use [an external keyboard](../keyboard) that I don't need to plug into my computer manually. The downside of this is that I have to carry extra batteries. These weigh a lot, and I think a better, wired keyboard would be better. It's also not a bad idea to make sure that your [headlamp](../head-lamp) takes the same batteries - mine take AAAs, so I failed that test here. You can shave some pounds off by making sure they are compatible.
