I lost this nondescript [carabiner](http://amzn.to/2oEfLhR) when I clipped it through a loop in my [Rothco top-loading army bag](http://amzn.to/2oUu68O) I use for moving mountaineering equipment, hoping that it would keep the damn thing closed, when I flew to the UK to go hiking on the West Highland Way for a week. It was cheap, but I used this particular 'biner for years as a grip for a 5-1 multiplier line when I was tightening my slackline, and I miss it for that purpose, at least.
