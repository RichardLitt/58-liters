[Nalgenes](/nalgene) are fantastic, but they weigh a lot, and they are the worst choice possible for anything other than water, as the plastic tends to keep the flavor of whatever you put in them. I wanted a small thermos I could use for coffee. I bought this at the [Alite Outpost](https://alitedesigns.com/) down the road from my house in the Mission, when I worked for [Hipcamp](https://hipcamp.com) and had a discount there as we were a camping company, too. It's a [Klean Kanteen](http://amzn.to/2nEztZH).

The problem with it is that hot water swiftly gets too hot, and cold water too cold. The metal is a very effective conducer of temperature. To offset this, I wrapped the whole thing in [colored duct tape](http://amzn.to/2o51uNa). I now wouldn't run out of duct tape, and I had a hand warmer. Boo-yah baby.

It dented easily, but was light weight and a nice little thermos.
