Finding good painkillers can be difficult, when you need them. I always carry some backup.

My mother has a habit of taking a few of these every day, for the migraines she gets. She used to wear heavy, red lipstick, and when I wouldn't be able to swallow the pill alone when I was sick while traveling, I would sometimes have to use her water bottle if we didn't have anything else. I'm 28, and I still connect the saccharine taste of Advil to lipstick smeared on the lip of a glass.

Because of this, I've used this bottle around twice in the years I've carried it. During those times, I've been grateful for it.
