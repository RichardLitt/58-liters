A pair of boots is the most important item you can bring with you, after a good backpack. They will get you through anything. I bought these boots, [Lowa Renegades](http://amzn.to/2nlVcq8), at a hiking megastore in New York, and I've walked with them on four continents, over hundreds of miles, from the mid-winter wastes of Svalbard to the summer in Buenos Aires, from the jungles of Thailand to the streets of Berlin. They're only falling apart now, three years later.

When they finally go, I'll but the same pair again.
