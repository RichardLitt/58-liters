"Always carry a headlamp." This was my motto for years. It is less useful now than it once was, as I generally seperate out my hiking gear from my travel gear better, and as my iPhone tends to have a light on it when I need one. However, after too many times trying to maneuver through catacombs in Malta, sewers in Paris, or caves in the Adirondacks, I tend to think that carrying an extra few ounces isn't the worst thing to do in the world. A headlamp is also incredibly helpful for late night or early morning runs; sometimes, those are the only times you can run, especially in places like Indonesia, when there are motorists everywhere during the day and it is too warm for long distances.

[Black Diamond](http://amzn.to/2nlLCmX) generally makes incredible headlamps, and you can pick them up in most places. I gave this one away to a friend by accident in Tokyo, who needed it for a late night run. I picked up another one the next week.
