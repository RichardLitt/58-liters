This is a gorgeous book about how to learn better, and how to place yourself in your career to be able to maximize growth through mentoring. Most code books teach you jargon - how to type this, how to say that. What they don't teach is the rest of the trade; where to learn, how to learn better, when to position yourself. This book aims to help with that, and was one of the more instructive books.

Or, it would have been, if I had ever finished reading it. I carried it around for months, but the mood never took me, and, at the time, I wasn't aware that scheduling a reading hour and sticking to it is how to get through books like this. I eventually gave this book away.
