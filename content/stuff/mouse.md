My friend Todd got me this mouse, when he visited family in San Diego. I could have bought one down the street in Germany without an issue, but I didn't know that at the time. I'm grateful to him, and I still use it today.

Save your fingers and use a mouse. There's a song by Sun Kil Moon about [his friend Brett](http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107859473851/):

> My friend Brett, my friend Brett, my friend Brett, my friend Brett, he liked to play the guitar.
> But he had an awkward way of playing bar chords with two fingers spreading his index and middle fingers really far apart.
> One day in band practice he dropped like a deer was shot and was flipping around like a fish.
> He had an aneurysm triggered by a nerve in his hand from the strain he was putting on it.
> I went to see him in Ohio; he had a horseshoe shaped scar on his scalp and he talked real slow.
> We played pool like we did in our teens and his head was shaved and he still wore bell-bottomed jeans.

> In '99 I was on tour in Sweden when I called home
> To tell my mom I got a part in a movie when she said "Mark, there's something that you need to know."
> "Brett died the other day, you really should send a letter to his mom and dad." And I got on my train in Malmo and looked out at the snow feeling somewhere between happy and sad.
> My friend Brett, my friend Brett. My friend Brett, my friend Brett. My friend Brett, my friend Brett, my friend Brett.
> He had a wife and a son.
> My friend Brett, my friend Brett, my friend Brett.
> He just liked to play guitar and he never hurt anyone.

Which is enough reason to get a mouse as anything else, really.
