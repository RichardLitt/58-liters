I sent this message to Bintang, after [The User is Drunk](https://theuserisdrunk.com) came out:

> Hey there, So - I made a site two weeks ago which has since gone viral, with 300,000 unique hits. It is called theuserisdrunk.com, and I offer a service where I get drunk and review people's websites. I've been exclusively drinking Bintang to achieve the state of mind needed to do this service, and I realize that I have been mentioning this in each video I make and post on my website - this equates to something like 100,000 free impressions for you. I was hoping that I could contact you about some sort of sponsorship deal in the future. I would like to continue drinking Bintang, and to say that you guys are sponsoring my work. Please get in touch! thanks.

I got this response:

> Dear Richard,

> We thank you for your loyalty to our Bintang product. And it will be more appreciated if you could enjoy our product responsibly as we always encourage our consumer to do so.

> Please continue to consume Bintang and spread the positive stories about Bintang.
Thank you and wish you all the best.

> Best Regards,

> REDACTED Consumer Complaint Officer & CAD Divisional Secretary
