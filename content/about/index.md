In March, 2015, I bought my [Osprey Exos 58](https://www.ospreypacks.com/ca/en/product/exos-58-EXOS58.html) pack in order to travel and live out of it for the unforseeable future. I was leaving San Francisco, where I had lived for a year, in order to head to Bali and Thailand on a one-way flight. Nominally, I was taking a break from the States.

I had given my last Osprey pack to a friend who had his stolen in South America while he was asleep in his hostel. And while I was walking in SF on my way to a library, my daypack I would have used was stolen by two kids with a gun, along with my laptop, phone, wallet, notebook, headphones, and the other accoutrement of a nomadic developer. I had one pack left; a 110 liter Kelty that weighed seven pounds, which my father had given me when I was 10, knowing that I could use it for years and that I would 'grow into it' (his words). I gave this to my flatmate for burning man, and after the dust of the playa was caked on it, I knew I would need something else.

So, I went to REI, and picked up the Exos 58. A perfect backpack. It has enough outside pockets to keep a bottle and a rain cover without any hassle. The top has a pocket if I need to store notebooks, pens, or other things for easy access, and it detaches if I want a slimmer bag, or just a small handbag (albeit, without a strap). The whole thing weighs only 2.05 pounds.
