I found this hat lying in the mud on a path in the Meadows of Edinburgh, in 2010. I picked it up, brushed it off. I've been wearing it every winter, since.

It's been with me on ski trips, to the Arctic, to Berlin's snow and Buenos Aires' parrots. I wear it when I go running, when I go walking and it's frigid out. When my beard was so cold that the frost grew icicles, it was on.

It is my very favorite hat.
