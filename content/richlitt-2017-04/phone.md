Ah, the iPhone 6SE. It's a tiny bit too big for running with - it tends to jump around a bit in the pocket on sprints. But, if you have a backpack to throw it in, or one of the fancier arm bands or lower back pockets, I don't think this would be an issue.

I use [MapMyRun](http://www.mapmyrun.com/) to log runs, although I write up how each run was afterwards in a run journal manually. Recently, while running with a pack, I start MapMyRun and then throw the bag in the pack, and listen to my iPod mini instead of trying myself to the phone. This gives the benefit that I don't have so much weight in my pockets, and that I don't tend to check it as much.

The iPhone is a lot more susceptible to water than the mini, which means you really oughtn't to bring it out when it rains. It's not worth the risk.

Personally, I hate these phones. I'd rather have a flip phone. But some apps - mail for tickets, calendar when on the go, and maps when travelings - are too valuable to not use. I lived without a phone for years in Europe, hitching across continents and writing things down in a travel journal. The phone is easier.
