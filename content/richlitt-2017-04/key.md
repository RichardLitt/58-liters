Keys are important.

Over the years, I've kept mine on carabiners, with can openers, memorandums of past travels, coupons. Eventually, as a perpetual nomad, I realized only two keys are important. My bike lock, and my front door.

That's all I carry now. The coupons can always be looked up, I've never owned a car, and keeping things lightweight means I can keep the keys in my pocket without too much of a bulge, or without the need to move the keys to the top of my bag. As well, when running, a lightweight key set means I can carry them with me without jangling, or without needing to hide a key near my door somewhere.

This morning, I realized that the bike key I'd had on this keychain was actually not needed, either. It goes to a lock I don't use with my bike at the moment, and I hadn't noticed because my bike has been in storage all winter. I could have gotten rid of it months ago.

Minimize.
