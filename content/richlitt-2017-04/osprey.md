The [Osprey Daylite](https://www.ospreypacks.com/ca/en/product/daylite-DAYLITE.html) is a lightweight 13 liter pack. It's great for a daypack or a running pack; there is both a waist strap and a breast strap, which means you can tie it in tight if you're looking to go running and you don't want it bouncing around.
That's what I do.

Maintaining an even surface on the back can be difficult if you have a full water bottle in the bottom, as it'll tend to collapse outwards;
using a sweatshirt to pad out the insides seems to stop this, but can also lead to a rounded back with pressure on the spine.
Short of getting a bag with a mesh backing, this is what you're in for with a smaller pack, however.

This is my girlfriend's; rocking a pink backpack while running in shorts through the snow is badass no matter the color though, let's face it.
