My iPhone died when I went running in a gale a couple of weeks ago. For a few days, I was stuck without my running apps, without music. Running for miles in a row without music is something akin to torture if you're not used to it.

So, I borrowed my girlfriend's pink iPod shuffle, and listened to her old music from 2009. What was amazing was how lightweight the thing was - as opposed to a phone, which bounced against my legs in my short pockets when I sprinted too fast, this thing just took up no time or effort.

On a Saturday shortly after, I ran six miles or so across the mountain in Montreal, enjoying the spring. I ran down the mountain direct into downtown, instead of the longer circuitous route to my house in the Plateau. Among the city streets and skyscrapers, I looked a bit odd, this bearded ruffian running next to taxis and window shoppers. I turned into the Apple Store and booked an appointment at the Genius Bar.

I figured, if I am going to go all the way downtown just to get my stuff fixed, there's no way I wouldn't use the opportunity to chalk up some miles, too.

They were booked, so I had to wait around for fourty minutes. I did this in a Starbucks across the street, reeking of sweat and reading my ever-present running book (you run with a book too, don't you?). When I went back, I explained that my phone was dead, and got a new one for free. At the same time, I bought this little doodad above.

I run with this around half of the time now. When I'm not interested in logging miles - a three mile run really doesn't need to be optimized for distance or speed, and I know exactly which tree to run to to make the distance work - I use the shuffle. It breaks up the otherwise boring monotony of Metallica and Spotify.
