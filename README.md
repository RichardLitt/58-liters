# 58 Liters

> An account of what I keep in my Osprey Exos 58

## About

This website is a place for showcasing what I've got in my bag.

I'd like for it to be exportable to other people, too, but there's work to do on that front.

### Thanks

The theme comes originally from [@kishaningithub](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme), although I have edited and adapted it and will continue to do so.

Thanks to [Steve Francia](https://github.com/spf13) for creating Hugo and the awesome community around the project. And also thanks to [Bootstrapious](http://bootstrapious.com/) for creating the original theme.
